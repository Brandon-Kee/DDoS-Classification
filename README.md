# DDoS Classification
This project focuses on detecting Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks by working with labeled network traffic data. It includes steps for preprocessing the data, visualizing patterns and anomalies, and training a Random Forest Classifier to identify malicious activity. The goal is to build an effective and interpretable model for distinguishing between normal and attack traffic.

## DDoS Attacks
A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a cyberattack where multiple compromised devices flood a target system, such as a website or server, with excessive traffic to overwhelm its resources and disrupt normal service. These attacks can cause downtime, slow performance, and loss of access for legitimate users. DDoS attacks are often used to extort, distract, or damage organizations by making their online services unavailable.
